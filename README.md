#BOOK'D

Book'D is a web applicaton that allows users to look for barbershops within their location using the leaflet API and book appointments. It also allows users to post their own shop onto our map to allow people to find and book with them.

The front end was built with React and makes requests to the [final-project-api](https://github.com/Estuardo-sanchez/final-project-api) server to fetch and store appointment and barbershops data.
